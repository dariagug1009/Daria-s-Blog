   <p class="descript">Hi! School started again after Christmas holiday and everyone in my school is talking about where they travelled to go skiing. 
    <br> To be honest, I prefer more going skiing in my country, Romania. The Carpathian mountains contain the most spectacular places to visit, even in winter. 
    Also, I prefer to ski in a resort in Romania, where I can eat traditional food, which I love.
    ​<br>As you saw in the title, this is not today's topic, but my ranking of places to visit in France. France is one of my favorite countries. Here is the ranking:
    <br>8. French Alpes
    <br>7. Avignon
    <br>6. Colmar
    <br>5. Montpellier
    <br>4. Toulouse
    <br>3. Mont Saint-Michelle
    <br>2. Strasbourgt
    <br>1. Paris

   <p class="descript">Hi! If you think that Harry Potter isn't worth the hype, you can skip this article, but for Harry Potter fans: Welcome!
    <br>Like three years ago, I discovered that a good friend of mine was obsessed with Harry Potter and since then I wanted more and more to read the Harry Potter, cause I ALWAYS read the book before seeing the film.
    <br>Last summer I finally started to read the books. I couldn't put the volume I was reading at that time down. I saw every single film at least once and I feel like I am a Ravenclaw.
    <br>Which house do you think you belong to? Let me now on the comment section below!

   <p class="descript">Hi, guys! Today is about desserts. They make us happy and can bring smiles on our faces. 
    <br>Two years ago I discovered macarons, probably the most famous French dessert. Even tho I eat them quite rarely, macarons have a special place in my heart.
    <br>Yesterday I tried a recipe with my mom, we had fun doing this and I can say they're delicious! Here is the recipe: </p>
    <table class="table">4 ¾ cups  Powdered Sugar
    <br>1 cup Almond Flour (finely ground)
    <br>1 teaspoon Salt (divided)
    <br>3 Egg Whites (at room temperature)
    <br>¼ cup Granulated Sugar
    <br>1 ½ teaspoons Vanilla Extract
    <br>2 drops Pink(or another color) Gel Food Coloring (optional)
    <br>1 cup Unsalted Butter (2 sticks, at room temperature)

   <p class="descript"> Hi! I'm Daria, a 14 years old girl with numerous passions. One of them is IT.
    <br>The reason why I started this block is because of my need to communicate, to determine others to try uncommon things and to make the on-line community a beter place. :)
    <br>I dream of becoming an astronaut or a scientist. I love maths and physics and I've always been courious to discover the world, the universe and to solve tricky challenges.
    <br>For my first article I want to talk about an interesting open star cluster: The Pleiades. It contains 4 different types of stars that glow together. Every star is unique.
    <br>I think that the Pleiades symbolizes union and friendship. We have to embrace differences, to normalize them and learn how to "glow" togheter. </p>
